There are some mistletoe clumps of reasonably large size with very ripe berries. The recent rains have pushed tiny shoots of winter grass in this was as well as those seen yesterday [on Parker 34-36]. There are piles of freshly dropped leaves underneath all fo the ironwoods here though the trees do not show it. Strangely, here as nowhere else I have seen locally, the wash ran as a result of the winter rains. The sand appears wet and saturated still.""

Other vertebrates noted: Lepus californicus - 1; Ammospermophilus leucurus - 1.--I noted the lack of any member of the sparrow guild and ground feeders - likely because the wash had run and washed all the seeds away. I also noted that I detected higher numbers of verdins and gnatcatchers than the previous month possibly because the birds are pairing up and are more vocal and visible. Also more Phainopeplas though they don't seem to be pairing yet. Some are giving a quiet twittery song.--I noted that this wash appeared to have run water within the last month although the last rain I could remember was on 6 November, one day prior to my last visit to these transects. On that day I had noted  that the wash was quite wet but did not appear to have run. That day in December I was unable to find my footprints from 7 November and, without running, those prints would still have been there. I wondered if there'd been another storm in those mountains since that we'd not noticed in Ehrenberg. Whatever the case, there had to have been some water in the wash as the Lycium in this wash which put out new growth in late September, died back quickly between then and November, but was now putting out much more new growth than it had in September.--Plant notes: Opuntia basillaris; O. rammosissima;Pectis papposa (blooming); Encelia frutescens; Coldenia plicata and Dalea emoryi over by the cliff edge; Atriplex polycarpa (with mature seed); Datura meteloides; Encelia farinosa; Euphorbia polycarpa; Euphorbia sp.; and Asclepias subulata (blooming); Hilaria rigida was found scattered amongst the adjacent creosote flats.

No significant visible damage. This was the only type V desert wash transect due to the size of the taller trees in the wash - the vegetation is very sparse compared to the type VI east side washes. Lycium dormant here (in contrast to the leafed out and flowering plants in the east side washes). Some of the smoke trees had put out a few blossoms that were just opening and Stephanomeria also in bloom.--Ash-throated Flycatchers have vacated these washes now.

However, much less effect, relatively, here from rains in September. I noted Lycium leafing out in October here but almost every plant has lost most of those leaves or, at the very least, they have dried up. Only one plant had a few green leaves remaining. Found two individuals of Physalis crassifolia with fruit from flowers that bloomed in response to those rains, however. The mistletoe berries were ""mostly new but a few are nearly ripe and the Phainopeplas are already eating them - only 1 Phainopepla was here on 10/9...""--I wondered if the D. merriami noted below had gotten wet and died from hypothermia overnight - maybe the wash did run or that animal's burrow got saturated somehow. There were no injuries evident on the animal. Saw loose flocks of feeding birds containing juncos, YRWA, verdins, gnatcatchers, white-crowns, and one Lincoln's Sparrow.

Also more Phainopeplas though they don't seem to be pairing yet. Some are giving a quiet twittery song.--I noted that this wash appeared to have run water within the last month although the last rain I could remember was on 6 November, one day prior to my last visit to these transects. On that day I had noted  that the wash was quite wet but did not appear to have run. That day in December I was unable to find my footprints from 7 November and, without running, those prints would still have been there. I wondered if there'd been another storm in those mountains since that we'd not noticed in Ehrenberg. Whatever the case, there had to have been some water in the wash as the Lycium in this wash which put out new growth in late September, died back quickly between then and November, but was now putting out much more new growth than it had in September.--Plant notes: Opuntia basillaris; O. rammosissima;Pectis papposa (blooming); Encelia frutescens; Coldenia plicata and Dalea emoryi over by the cliff edge; Atriplex polycarpa (with mature seed); Datura meteloides; Encelia farinosa; Euphorbia polycarpa; Euphorbia sp.; and Asclepias subulata (blooming); Hilaria rigida was found scattered amongst the adjacent creosote flats.

However, much less effect, relatively, here from rains in September. I noted Lycium leafing out in October here but almost every plant has lost most of those leaves or, at the very least, they have dried up. Only one plant had a few green leaves remaining. Found two individuals of Physalis crassifolia with fruit from flowers that bloomed in response to those rains, however. The mistletoe berries were ""mostly new but a few are nearly ripe and the Phainopeplas are already eating them - only 1 Phainopepla was here on 10/9...""--I wondered if the D. merriami noted below had gotten wet and died from hypothermia overnight - maybe the wash did run or that animal's burrow got saturated somehow. There were no injuries evident on the animal. Saw loose flocks of feeding birds containing juncos, YRWA, verdins, gnatcatchers, white-crowns, and one Lincoln's Sparrow.
